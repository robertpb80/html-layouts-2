		<p>Our goal has always been to make powerful technology more accessible. More relevant. And ultimately more personal. Apple Watch represents a new chapter in the relationship people have with technology. It’s the most personal product we’ve ever made, because it’s the first one designed to be worn.</p>

		<p>Every aspect of Apple Watch is designed for precisely when you use it and where you wear it — on your wrist. Each interaction is quick and light. Right from the watch face, the Glances feature gives you real-time views of the information you check most often, like the weather, stock quotes, upcoming calendar events, and more. Apple Watch notifications take on a whole new feel because they discreetly come right to your wrist. And they’re designed to let you address or dismiss them just as subtly. </p>
